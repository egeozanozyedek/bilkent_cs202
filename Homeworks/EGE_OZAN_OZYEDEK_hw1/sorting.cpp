 Unlike the implementation given to us, I was required to take only one integer values (size) instead of two (first and last). This perhaps optimizes the function itself but not the implementation. It creates two "arrays", left and right, which are just pointers (left points to the start of the initial array, right points to the middle point of the initial array. They have sizes accordingly)

 Again, this was challenging since we dont have simple int values, but it is not much different from the actual implementation. It takes all array values and sizes, compares elements and creates a temporary sorted array. This temp array is then copied onto the actual array. Hence the array is sorted.

 Again, similar to the obstacle we had in mergesort, I am only given one int variable. So again, pointers are in use. The difference between quick and merge sort is that quick sort makes comparisons first. So the array is "divided" after the fact. So, I initialize left and right arrays as NULL and sizes as zero. These change accordingly in partition. Also the pivot is chosen as the first element.

 Not very different from the version in the slides. The pivot is the first element, then the array is traversed to create the left and right arrays. The left and right arrays are taken as reference to a pointer.
